Taking part in Game Jams can be a fun experience, in which you have to get creative fast, as you have 24-48 hours to build a prototype of a game. I just recalled my experience at the Ubisoft Game Jam in Bucharest, in November of 2015 - which lasted for 24 hours.

I was in a team of four programmers, and we decided to develop a game that makes use of VR (using the Oculus Rift Headset). As mentioned in this [article](https://playtech.ro/2015/cat-ti-ar-lua-sa-faci-urmatorul-joc-fenomen-24-de-ore/) (it is in Romanian): "Am văzut un joc FPS de realitate virtuală care combina grafica de Counter Strike cu cea de Minecraft și în care una dintre arme era un cap de cal care lansa rachete." we developed a FPS VR game that combined Counter-Strike like gameplay and weapons with blocky Minecraft-like Domino enemies.

The player's objective was to protect a Nexus (think important base) fom hordes of Demonoes. In order to destroy a whole group of enemies, one could hit the front-most enemy to make the whole group fall on each other (the domino effect).

We had diverse weapons, ranging from classical ones like the AK47 to a lightning gun and, as mentioned in the aforementioned article, a horse-head gun that shoots rockets :).

The weapons automatically switch every X seconds, to make the game more dynamic and difficult (otherwise, you could just pick one of the most powerful weapons).

The player can move around quickly using a jetpack - as long as fuel lasts (it is replenished automatically when not in use). We limited the player's movement to the jetpack, and direction is controlled by moving the head towards the desired area.

The UI consists of two vertical gauges for the health and jetpack fuel as well as an initial tutorial HUD and on-screen prompts. Finally, the player uses an Xbox 360 controller to shoot and use the jetpack (see the figure below).

We developed the prototype in Unity.

Overall, it was a very fun experience, even though we did not win anything at the game jam. In order to make the game more interesting, the level design could have made use of some vertical platforms (as you can see above, it is flat), so one could use the jetpack to traverse between them. Unfortunately, we did not have time to implement them.

It was also very interesting to see what others have done. For more information about that, as well as the winning projects, please check the article I linked above.
